// ============ JSX syntax ==============
/*
JSX is very much like Html in Js but with slight differences. This line below will pass as JSX
const heading = <h1>I am a heading</h1>; 
(don't forget to end with the semi-colon as in normal Js, since it's more or less a Js decalaration).

If you have a long line of JSX, it's best to break it down for readability
