 # Overview

 This is a library of my Js practice codes.

 A lot are codes I've written myself as part of learning JavaSript via several means like Codecademy, Udemy, FreeCodeCamp, Coursera, and YouTube. This is me having them all in one place and in an online repo as another way to not lose my work.
